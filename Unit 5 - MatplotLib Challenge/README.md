# Matplotlib-Challenge - Pymaceuticals

## **This Homework has the following outputs:**

### **1.  Pymaceuticals - Jupyter Notebook**

This [file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/tree/master/Unit%205%20-%20MatplotLib%20Challenge/Pymaceuticals) provides program codes that output various graphs and tables that determine the results of the cancer treatments across different drug regimen for 248 mice.  

**The output are as follows:**
*    Summary Statistics of Tumor Volume by Drug Regimen - Groupby Method
*    Summary Statistics of Tumor Volume by Drug Regimen - Aggregate Method
*    Bar Graph of Unique Mice by Drug Regimen - Dataframe Panda Method
*    Bar Graph of Unique Mice by Drug Regimen - Pyplot Method
*    Pie Chart of Mice Gender Distribution - Dataframe Panda Method
*    Pie Chart of Mice Gender Distribution - Pyplot Method
*    Quartiles and Interquartiles Results of the 4 Most Promising Drug Regimen
*    Outliers of the 4 Most Promising Drug Regimen
*    Boxplot of the 4 Most Promising Drug Regimen
*    Line Graph of Tumor Size vs Timepoint for a Specific Mouse under the Capomulin Drug Regimen
*    Scatter Plot of Average Tumor Size vs Weight for the Capomulin Drug Regimen
*    Coefficient Correlation and Linear Regression Model t of Average Tumor Size vs Weight for the Capomulin Drug Regimen

The data frame is extracted from the following CSV Files in the [data directory](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/tree/master/Unit%205%20-%20MatplotLib%20Challenge/Pymaceuticals/data):
*    [Mouse Metadata](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%205%20-%20MatplotLib%20Challenge/Pymaceuticals/data/Mouse_metadata.csv)
*    [Study Results](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%205%20-%20MatplotLib%20Challenge/Pymaceuticals/data/Study_results.csv)


### **2.  Pymaceuticals Observations**
Based on the analysis from the Dataframes created in the Jupyter Notebook file, a report on 3 major observations have been documented.
