## **This Homework has 2 Folders:**

### **1.  PyBank**

This program is to provide a summary of the Profit & Losses (P&L) over the periods of Jan 2010 - Feb 2017 from the [PyBank Records](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/tree/master/PyBank/Results/Resources).  It calculates the result for the following:

*    Number of months
*    Total P&L
*    Average Change in P&L
*    Month with Minimum Change in P&L
*    Month with Maximum Change in P&L


There are 2 Folders that include:

* **Results**
    
    *   [Main.py](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/Results/main.py) - This is the main code for PyBank.  Please run it on Visual Studio Code.
    
    *   [PyBank Terminal Output](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/Results/PyBank%20-%20Terminal%20Output.docx) - This is the screenshot of how the code is displayed on the Visual Studio Code Terminal upon success.
    
    *   [Financial Summary](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/Results/Financial_Summary.txt) - Text output file for the results.
    
    *   [Resources](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/tree/master/PyBank/Results/Resources) - The CSV source file of all the P&L over Jan 2017 - Feb 2017.

**Note:  Please check the directory path before running the code.  It should be ...\Homework\Unit 3- Python Challenge\PyBank\Results**

* **Test**

    *   [PyBank_Test.py](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/Test/PyBank_Test.py) - This is where I tested to ensure the code runs properly.  Comments are provided to explain how I got the solution.

### **2.  PyPoll**

This program is to provide an efficient counting process to provide the Election Results for a small rural town.  It calculates the result for the following:
* Total Number of Votes Cast
* Complete List of Candidates who Received Votes
* Percentage Won by Each Candidate
* Total Number of Votes by Each Candidate
* The Winner of the Election Based on Popular Vote

There are 2 Folders inside this code that includes:

* **Results**
    
    *  [Main.py](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Results/main.py) - This is the main code for PyPoll.  Please run it on Visual Studio Code.
    
    *  [PyPoll Terminal Output](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Results/PyPoll%20-%20Terminal%20Output.docx) - This is the screenshot of how the code is displayed on Visual Studio Code Terminal upon success.
    
    *  [PyPoll_Results](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Results/PyPoll_Results.txt) - Text output file for the results.
    
    *  [Resources](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Results/Resources/Py_Poll.csv) - The CSV source file of the election results.

**Note:  Please check the directory path before running the code.  It should be ...\Homework\Unit 3- Python Challenge\PyPollResults**


* **Test**

    *   [PyPoll_Test_Index.py](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Test/Py_Poll_Test_Index.py) - Code is ran based on the index number of the unique list generated in the code.  Comments are provided to explain how I got the solution.
    
    *   [PyPoll_Test_Loop.py](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Test/PyPoll_Test_Loop.py) - Another code is written because running the file based on the index requires manual inputs for more lines if new candidates are added to the list.  Using a for loop will overcome this as the code will go through every row to search for the candidate.  Comments are provided to explain how I got the solution.
    
    *    [Resources](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Python-Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Test/Resources/Py_Poll.csv) - The CSV source file for the election results.
