# Python API -Challenge - Weatherpy

To understand how the weather works globally, a Python script have been created for 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator. With the help of a Python Library, the OpenWeatherMap API and some programming technique, weather information have been extracted for all these cities.

## **The Summary of Results have the following outputs:**

### **1.  WeatherPy - Jupyter Notebook**

This [file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%206%20-%20Python%20API%20Challege/WeatherPy.ipynb) provides program codes that output the weather infomration and scatterplot graphs for 500+ cities and tables that determine the how the cities' latitude is correlated with the temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. 

#### **The output are as follows:**

*  **Analysis of WeatherPy Results**

*  **Generate Cities List**
    * Print Record of City List
    * Dataframe of City Weather Information
    
*  **Plotting the Data - Scatter Plots**
    * Latitude vs. Maximum Temperature (F)
    * Latitude vs. Humidity (%)
    * Latitude vs. Cloudiness (%)
    * Latitude vs. Windspeed (mph)
    
*  **Linear Regression**
    * Northern Hemisphere - Maximum Temperature (F) vs Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Maximum Temperature (F) vs Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude     
    * Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude   
    * Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
    
### **2.  API Keys - Python File**
This [file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%206%20-%20Python%20API%20Challege/api_key.py) is to save the Openweather Map API keys to extract weather information for the various cities.

### **3.  Output Files Folder**
