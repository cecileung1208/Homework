# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

As a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard., management  made a request to research on employee data from the 1980s to 1990s. Six CSV databases were available to conduct the analysis. Since there were numerous rows and the information were scattered across the databases, I must go through the below 3 steps of Data Modeling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis to complete my investigation.


## **1.  Data Modeling**

To conduct any data analysis, a data engineer must know what information the databases contain and how the attributes are related to one another. The perfect way is to map it out in a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in  [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com]( http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).  See the below image to see how ERD of the Employee Databases.

* The [Data Model](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Output%20Files/ERD%20-%20Employee%20Database.png) is saved in the output directory.
* Each box represents a table and its attributes (columns). 
* The data types are listed for each attribute.
* The key icon represents the primary keys uniquely identifies the records in each table.
* The line that connects to each table shows how the tables are related through common attirbutes.  
* The line also shows the type of relationship of the common attributes.  See the below image to determine the type relationship between the tables.

## **2.  Data Engineering**

Based on the above Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), a [table schema](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Table_Schema.sql) has been exported as a sql file to create the tables in PostgerSQL.

The table schema information is based on the six CSV files where all data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints are specified .

After running the table_schema.sql and creating the headings for each table for Postregres, we must import ach CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

**Note: Be sure to import the data in the same order that the tables were created and account for the headers when importing to avoid errors.**

The below table shows which table corresponds to which CSV file and the import should be run in the following order:

| SQL Table Name    | Corresponding CSV Table |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| "Departments"  | [departments.csv](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Resources/departments.csv)  |
| "Titles"  | [titles.csv](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Resources/titles.csv)  |
| "Employees"  | [employees.csv](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Resources/employees.csv)  |
| "Salaries"  | [salaries.csv](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Resources/salaries.csv)  |
| "Dept_Emp"  | [dept_emp.csv](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Resources/dept_emp.csv)  |
| "Dept_Manager"  | [dept_manager.csv](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Resources/dept_manager.csv)  |



## **3.  Data Analysis**

After completing the Data Modeling and Data Engineering steps, we have all the information to extract specific employee information from the databases. 

To conduct our Employee Data Analysis, a [queries file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Queries.sql) has been created to retrieve the following employee information.

1.  List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2.  List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3.  List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4.  List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5.  List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6.  List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7.  List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8.  In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


## **4.  Bonus**

Upon examining the data, I wanted to test the validity of the dataset to ensure it is accurate. To confirm this, the [Bonus file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Bonus.ipynb) has been created to import the PostgreSQL database to Pandas Dataframes via SQL Alchemy.

Note: [gitignore](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/.gitignore) file has been created to ensure others do not have my personal access to my PostgreSQL.

The following steps are used generate a visualization of the data:

1.  [Historgram - Most Common Salary Ranges for Employees](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Output%20Files/Salary%20Ranges%20for%20Employees.png)
2.  [Bar Chart - Average Salary by Title](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Output%20Files/Average%20Salary%20by%20Title.png)

## **5.  Folders and Directories**

The below folders have the following files:

| Folder Name    | File Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Employee SQL  | [Table_Schema.sql](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Homework/blob/master/Unit%209%20-%20SQL%20Challenge/Employee_SQL/Table_Schema.sql)  |
